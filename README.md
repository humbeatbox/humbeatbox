### Featured Project

#### Cloud-Native Learning Management System
`MERN` `Kubernetes (K3s)` `Terraform` `ArgoCD` `Jenkins` `AWS`

A production-grade learning platform with a full GitOps pipeline — not a tutorial project.

- **Infrastructure as Code** — Terraform-managed VPCs, EC2 instances, and Security Groups on AWS
- **Container Orchestration** — Microservices deployed to K3s with Secrets Management and RBAC
- **CI/CD Pipeline** — Jenkins + ArgoCD with dynamic K8s build agents, parallelized builds, and self-healing deployments
- **Application Layer** — MERN stack with JWT auth (Passport.js), bcrypt, role-based access, and Nginx reverse proxy
- **Result** — 80% reduction in deployment lead time, zero-downtime updates across environments

### Career Context

Most recently at **Ai Financial** (Co-op, 2025) — built Python ELT pipelines processing 200k+ daily financial records, deployed Terraform-managed Azure infrastructure, and ran GitOps workflows with Jenkins/ArgoCD to Kubernetes.

Before that, **6+ years at Taiwan's Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau** — managed 300+ user IAM roles, coordinated VM provisioning across DMZ environments, led digitalization of chain-of-custody systems, and enforced ISO 27001 compliance.
